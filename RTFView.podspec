  s.description      = <<-DESC
  This custom view has three parts: parser, component(s) and the view itself. The Parser
  converts the formatted text into a list of tokens each containing a list of tags and the text
  itself. The component converts a list of consecutive tokens, which all have
  the same "main" tag, into a view representing the formatting. They also can be combined. The view
  itself wraps up these two components into a process of clearing the view tree, getting the new
  token list from the parser and passing it to the root component.
